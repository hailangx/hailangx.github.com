## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Webhook Manager Service
- **Responsibility**: Handle webhook CRUD operations
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /webhooks` - Register new webhook
  - `GET /webhooks/{id}` - Retrieve webhook details
  - `PUT /webhooks/{id}` - Update webhook configuration
  - `DELETE /webhooks/{id}` - Remove webhook
- **Data Access**: Reads/writes to Webhook Metadata DB

#### 2. Event Trigger Service
- **Responsibility**: Receive events and initiate webhook processing
- **Flow**:
  1. Receive events from event queue
  2. Query Webhook Metadata DB for matching webhooks
  3. Create execution tasks and enqueue to execution queue
- **Caching**: Uses cache layer for frequently accessed webhook configurations

#### 3. Execution Queue
- **Technology**: Message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
- **Purpose**: Decouple event reception from webhook delivery
- **Features**:
  - Persistent storage for durability
  - Support for message prioritization
  - Dead letter queue for failed deliveries

#### 4. Worker Pool
- **Responsibility**: Process webhook deliveries
- **Characteristics**:
  - Horizontally scalable
  - Pull messages from execution queue
  - Make HTTP requests to webhook endpoints
  - Record execution results to delivery log DB
- **Error Handling**:
  - Implement retry logic based on webhook configuration
  - Update delivery status in logs
  - Route permanently failed deliveries to monitoring system

#### 5. Retry Service
- **Responsibility**: Handle failed webhook deliveries
- **Retry Strategies**:
  - Exponential backoff
  - Fixed interval
  - Custom retry schedules
- **Configuration**: Per-webhook retry policy settings

#### 6. Monitoring Manager
- **Responsibility**: Provide observability into webhook operations
- **Features**:
  - Dashboard for webhook status
  - Execution metrics and analytics
  - Alert generation for failures
  - Historical trend analysis

#### 7. Load Balancer
- **Purpose**: Distribute incoming requests across service instances
- **Targets**:
  - Webhook Manager API
  - Event Trigger Service
  - Monitoring endpoints

### Data Stores

#### Webhook Metadata Database
**Schema**:
```
Webhook {
  web_hook_id: UUID (PK)
  url: String
  auth: JSON (credentials, tokens)
  event_type: String[]
  user_id: UUID
  expire_at: Timestamp
  status: Enum (active, inactive, expired)
  retry_type: Enum (exponential, fixed, custom)
  created_at: Timestamp
  updated_at: Timestamp
}
```
**Characteristics**:
- Relational DB for ACID properties
- Indexed on user_id, event_type for fast queries

#### Webhook Delivery Log Database
**Schema**:
```
execution_log {
  event_id: UUID (PK)
  event_type: String
  webhook: JSON (snapshot of webhook config)
  status: Enum (pending, success, failure, retrying)
  response_code: Integer
  response_body: Text
  attempt_count: Integer
  executed_at: Timestamp
  next_retry_at: Timestamp
}
```
**Characteristics**:
- High write throughput optimization
- Time-series optimized storage
- Partitioned by date for efficient querying

#### Cache Layer
- **Purpose**: Reduce database load for frequently accessed webhooks
- **Cached Data**:
  - Active webhook configurations
  - Event-to-webhook mappings
- **Cache Invalidation**: On webhook updates/deletions

## Data Flow

### Webhook Registration Flow
```
User → Load Balancer → Webhook Manager → Webhook Metadata DB
                                      ↓
                                    Cache (update)
```

### Event Processing Flow
```
Event Source → Events Queue → Event Trigger Service
                                    ↓
                          Query Cache/Metadata DB
                                    ↓
                            Execution Queue → Worker Pool → Webhook Endpoint
                                                    ↓
                                          Delivery Log DB
                                                    ↓
                                    (if failure) → Retry Service
```

### Monitoring Flow
```
User → Load Balancer → Monitoring Manager → Delivery Log DB
                                                  ↓
                                         (analytics & metrics)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Queue-Based Architecture
- **Rationale**: Decouples event generation from delivery, enabling better scalability and fault tolerance
- **Trade-off**: Adds latency but improves reliability

### 2. Worker Pool Pattern
- **Rationale**: Allows independent scaling of webhook delivery capacity
- **Implementation**: Workers compete for messages from execution queue

### 3. Execution Log Persistence
- **Rationale**: Enables audit trails, debugging, and monitoring
- **Optimization**: Consider time-based archival for old logs

### 4. Cache Integration
- **Rationale**: Reduces database load for hot webhook configurations
- **Strategy**: Cache-aside pattern with TTL-based expiration

### 5. Retry Service Separation
- **Rationale**: Specialized handling of failed deliveries without blocking main worker pool
- **Pattern**: Scheduled retry jobs with exponential backoff

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling Components
- Webhook Manager (stateless API)
- Event Trigger Service
- Worker Pool (most critical for throughput)
- Monitoring Manager

### Bottleneck Mitigation
- **Database**: Read replicas for webhook metadata, sharding for delivery logs
- **Queue**: Partitioned topics/queues for parallel processing
- **Workers**: Auto-scaling based on queue depth

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication**:
   - Support for multiple auth methods (API keys, OAuth, JWT)
   - Encrypted storage of credentials

2. **Request Validation**:
   - HMAC signatures for webhook payloads
   - Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Per-webhook delivery rate limits
   - Circuit breaker pattern for problematic endpoints

4. **Data Protection**:
   - TLS for all communications
   - PII handling compliance

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Delivery success rate
- Average delivery latency
- Queue depth
- Worker utilization
- Retry rate
- Endpoint availability

### Alerts
- High failure rate for specific webhooks
- Queue backup/overflow
- Worker pool saturation
- Database connection issues

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Filtering**: Allow complex event filtering based on payload content
2. **Webhook Templates**: Pre-configured webhook patterns for common use cases
3. **Delivery Guarantee Options**: Support for at-most-once and exactly-once semantics
4. **Payload Transformation**: Allow users to customize webhook payload format
5. **Multi-region Deployment**: Geographic distribution for lower latency
6. **Webhook Testing**: Sandbox environment for webhook validation
